## 10.2 Code-Scheduling Constraints

### 10.2.1

> The assignments in Fig. 10.5 have certain dependences. For each of the following pairs of statements, classify the dependence.

> ```
1) a = b
2) c = d
3) b = c
4) d = a
5) c = d
6) a = b
```

> a) Statements (1) and (4).

True dependence.

> b) Statements (3) and (5).

Antidependence.

> c) Statements (1) and (6).

Output dependence.

> d) Statements (3) and (6).

True dependence.

> e) Statements (4) and (6).

Antidependence.

### 10.2.2

> Evaluate the expression `((u+v)+(w+x))+(y+z)` exactly as parenthesized. Give register-level machine code to provide the maximum possible parallelism.
