## 8.3 Addresses in the Target Code

### 8.3.1

> Generate code for the following three-address statements assuming stack allocation where register `SP` points to the top of the stack.

> ```
call p
call q
return
call r
return
return
```

```
100: LD  SP, #stackStart
108: ADD SP, SP, #psize
116: ST  0(SP), #132
124: BR  #pstart
132: SUB SP, SP, #psize
140: ADD SP, SP, #qsize
148: ST  0(SP), #164
156: BR  #qstart
164: SUB SP, SP, #qsize
172: BR  *0(SP)
```

### 8.3.2

> Generate code for the following three-address statements assuming stack allocation where register `SP` points to the top of the stack.

> a) `x = 1`

> b) `x = a`

> c) `x = a + 1`

> d) `x = a + b`

> e) The two statements

> ```
x = b * c
y = a + x
```

### 8.3.3

> Generate code for the following three-address statements again assuming stack allocation and assuming `a` and `b` are arrays whose elements are 4-byte values.

> a) The four-statement sequence

> ```
x = a[i]
y = b[j]
a[i] = y
b[j] = x
```

> b) The three-statement sequence

> ```
x = a[i]
y = b[i]
z = x * y
```

> c) The three-statement sequence

> ```
x = a[i]
y = b[x]
a[i] = y
```
