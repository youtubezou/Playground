## 8.2 The Target Language

### 8.2.1

> Generate code for the following three-address statements assuming all variables are stored in memory locations.

> a) `x = 1`

```
LD R1, #1
ST x, R1
```

> b) `x = a`

```
LD R1, a
ST x, R1
```

> c) `x = a + 1`

```
LD  R1, a
ADD R1, R1, #1
ST  x, R1
```

> d) `x = a + b`

```
LD  R1, a
LD  R2, b
ADD R1, R1, R2
ST  x, R1
```

> e) The two statements

> ```
x = b * c
y = a + x
```

```
LD  R1, b
LD  R2, c
MUL R2, R1, R2
LD  R1, a
ADD R1, R1, R2
ST  y, R1
```

### 8.2.2

> Generate code for the following three-address statements assuming `a` and `b` are arrays whose elements are 4-byte values.

> a) The four-statement sequence

> ```
x = a[i]
y = b[j]
a[i] = y
b[j] = x
```

```
LD  R1, i
MUL R1, R1, #4
LD  R2, a(R1)
LD  R3, j
MUL R3, R3, #4
LD  R4, b(R3)
ST  a(R1), R4
ST  b(R3), R2
```

> b) The three-statement sequence

> ```
x = a[i]
y = b[i]
z = x * y
```

```
LD  R1, i
MUL R1, R1, #4
LD  R2, a(R1)
LD  R1, a(R2)
MUL R1, R2, R1
ST  z, R1
```

> c) The three-statement sequence

> ```
x = a[i]
y = b[x]
a[i] = y
```

```
LD  R1, i
MUL R1, R1, #4
LD  R2, a(R1)
MUL R2, R2, #4
LD  R2, b(R2)
ST  a(R1), R2
```

### 8.2.3

> Generate code for the following three-address sequence assuming that `p` and `q` are in memory locations:

> ```
y = *q
q = q + 4
*p = y
p = p + 4
```

```
LD  R1, q
LD  R2, 0(R1)
ADD R1, R1, #4
LD  R3, p
LD  R4, 0(R3)
ADD R3, R3, #4
```
