## 8.9 Instruction Selection by Tree Rewriting

### 8.9.1

> Construct syntax trees for each of the following statements assuming all nonconstant operands are in memory locations:

> a) `x = a * b + c * d`

> b) `x[i] = y[j] * z[k]`

> c) `x = x + 1`

### 8.9.2

> Repeat Exercise 8.9.1 above using the syntax-directed translation scheme in Fig. 8.21 in place of the ree-rewriting scheme.

### 8.9.3

> Extend the tree-rewriting scheme in Fig. 8.20 to apply to while-statements.

### 8.9.4

> How would you extend tree rewriting to apply to DAG's?
