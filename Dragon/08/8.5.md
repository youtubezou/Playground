## 8.5 Optimization of Basic Blocks

### 8.5.1

> Construct the DAG for the basic block

> ```
d = b * c
e = a + b
b = b * c
a = e - d
```

```
          +--+--+
          |  -  |  a
          +-+++-+
            | |
        +---+ +---+
        |         |
     +--v--+   +--v--+
  e  |  +  |   |  *  |  d,b
     +-+++-+   +-+-+-+
       | |       | |
   +---+ +--+ +--+ +---+
   |        | |        |
+--v--+   +-v-v-+   +--v--+
|  a0 |   |  b0 |   |  c  |
+-----+   +-----+   +-----+
```

### 8.5.2

> Simplify the three-address code of Exercise 8.5.1, assuming

> a) Only $$a$$ is live on exit from the block.

> b) $$a$$, $$b$$, and $$c$$ are live on exit from the block.
