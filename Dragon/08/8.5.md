### 8.5.2

> a) Only $$a$$ is live on exit from the block.

```
d = b * c
e = a + b
a = e - d
```

> b) $$a$$, $$b$$, and $$c$$ are live on exit from the block.

```
e = a + b
b = b * c
a = e - b
```

### 8.5.3

> Construct the DAG for the code in block $$B_6$$ of Fig. 8.9. Do not forget to include the comparison $$i \le 10$$.

### 8.5.5

> Extend Algorithm 8.7 to process three-statements of the form

> a) `a[i] = b`

> b) `a = b[i]`

> c) `a = *b`

> d) `*a = b`

1. ...
2. set $$a$$ to "not live" and "no next use".
3. set $$b$$ (and $$i$$) to "live" and the next uses of $$b$$ (and $$i$$) to statement

### 8.5.6

> Construct the DAG for the basic block

> ```
a[i] = b
*p = c
d = a[j]
e = *p
*p = a[i]
```

> on the assumption that

> a) `p` can point anywhere.

Calculate `a[i]` twice.

> b) `p` can point only to `b` or `d`.

> Revise the DAG-construction algorithm to take advantage of such situations, and apply your algorithm to the code of Exercise 8.5.6.

```
a[i] = b
d = a[j]

*p = b
```

### 8.5.8

> Suppose a basic block is formed from the C assignment statements

> ```
x = a + b + c + d + e + f;
y = a + c + e;
```

> a) Give the three-address statements for this block.

```
t1 = a + b
t2 = t1 + c
t3 = t2 + d
t4 = t3 + e
t5 = t4 + f
x = t5
t6 = a + c
t7 = t6 + e
y = t7
```

> b) Use the associative and commutative laws to modify the block to use the fewest possible number of instructions, assuming both `x` and `y` are live on exit from the block.

```
t1 = a + c
t2 = t1 + e
y = t2
t3 = t2 + b
t4 = t3 + d
t5 = t4 + f
x = t5
```
