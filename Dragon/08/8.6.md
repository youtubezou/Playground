## 8.6 A Simple Code Generator

### 8.6.1

> For each of the following C assignment statements generate three-address code, assuming that all array elements are integers taking four bytes each. In parts (d) and (e), assume that `a`, `b` and `c` are constants giving the location of the first (0th) elements of the arrays with those names, as in all previous examples of array accesses in this chapter.

> a) `x = a + b*c;`

```
t1 = b * c
t2 = a + t1
x = t2
```

> b) `x = a/(b+c) - d*(e+f);`

```
t1 = b + c
t2 = a / t1
t3 = e + f
t4 = d * t3
t5 = t2 - t4
x = t5
```

> c) `x = a[i] + 1;`

```
t1 = i * 4
t2 = a[t1]
t3 = t2 + 1
x = t3
```

> d) `a[i] = b[c[i]];`

```
t1 = i * 4
t2 = c[t1]
t3 = t2 * 4
t4 = b[t3]
a[t1] = t4
```

> e) `a[i][j] = b[i][k] + c[k][j];`

```
t1 = i * n
t2 = t1 + k
t3 = t2 * 4
t4 = b[t3]
t5 = k * n
t6 = t5 + j
t7 = t6 * 4
t8 = c[t7]
t9 = t4 + t8
t10 = t1 + j
t11 = t10 * 4
a[t11] = t9
```

> f) `*p++ = *q++;`

Assume that `++` has higher priority than `*`.

```
t1 = *q
t2 = q + 4
q = t2
*p = t1
t3 = p + 4
p = t3
```
