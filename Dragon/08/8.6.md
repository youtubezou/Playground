## 8.6 A Simple Code Generator

### 8.6.1

> For each of the following C assignment statements generate three-address code, assuming that all array elements are integers taking four bytes each. In parts (d) and (e), assume that `a`, `b` and `c` are constants giving the location of the first (0th) elements of the arrays with those names, as in all previous examples of array accesses in this chapter.

> a) `x = a + b*c;`

> b) `x = a/(b+c) - d*(e+f);`

> c) `x = a[i] + 1;`

> d) `a[i] = b[c[i]];`

> e) `a[i][j] = b[i][k] + c[k][j];`

> f) `*p++ = *q++;`
