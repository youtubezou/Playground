## 8.4 Basic Blocks and Flow Graphs

### 8.4.1

> Figure 8.10 is a simple matrix-multiplication program.

> a) Translate the program into three-address statements of the type we have been using in this section. Assume the matrix entries are numbers that require 8 bytes, and the matrices are stored in row-major order.

> ```
for (i=0; i<n; i++)
    for (j=0; j<n; j++)
        c[i][j] = 0.0
for (i=0; i<n; i++)
    for (j=0; j<n; j++)
        for (k=0; k<n; k++)
            c[i][j] = c[i][j] + a[i][k]*b[k][j]
```


> b) Construct the flow graph for your code from (a).

> c) Identify the loops in your flow graph from (b).
