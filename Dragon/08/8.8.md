## 8.8 Register Allocation and Assignment

### 8.8.1

> Construct the register-interference graph for the program in Fig. 8.17.

B1:

* a: {b, c, d, e, f}
* b: {a, c, d}
* c: {a, b}
* d: {a, b}
* e: {a, f}
* f: {a, e}

### 8.8.2

> Devise a register-allocation strategy on the assumption that we automatically store all registers on the stack before procedure call and restore them after the return.

All registers are live before procedure call, no register is live after the return.
