## 2.8 Intermediate Code Generation

### 2.8.1

> For-statements in C and Java have the form:

> $$\text{for}~(~expr_1~;~expr_2~;~expr_3~)~stmt$$

> The first expression is executed before the loop; it is typically used for initialization the loop index. The second expression is a test made before each iterator of the loop; the loop is exited if the expression becomes 0. The loop itself can be thought of as the statement $$\{stmt~expr_3;\}$$. The third expression is executed at the end of each iteration; it is typically used to increment the loop index. The meaning of thefor-statement is similar to

> $$expr_1;~\text{while}~(~expr_2~)~\{~stmt~expr_3;~\}$$

> Define a class `For` for for-statements, similar to class `If1` in Fig. 2.43.

### 2.8.2

> The programming language C does not have a boolean type. Show how a C compiler might translate an if-statement into three-address code.
