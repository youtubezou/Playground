## 9.6 Loops in Flow Graphs

### 9.6.1

> For the flow graph of Fig. 9.10:

> i. Compute the dominator relation.

> ii. Find the immediate dominator of each node.

> iii. Construct the dominator tree.

> iv. Find one depth-first ordering for the flow graph.

> v. Indicate the advancing, retreating, cross, and tree edges for your answer to iv.

> vi. Is the flow graph reducible?

> vii. Compute the depth of the flow graph.

> viii. Find the nature loops of the flow graph.
