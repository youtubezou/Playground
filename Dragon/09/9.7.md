## 9.7 Region-Based Analysis

### 9.7.1

> For the flow graph of Fig. 9.10:

> i. Find all the possible regions.

> ii. Give the set of nested regions constructed by Algorithm 9.52.

* $$R_7 = \{ R_3, R_4 \}$$
* $$R_8 = \{ R_7 \}$$
* $$R_9 = \{ R_2, R_8, R_5 \}$$
* $$R_{10} = \{ R_9 \}$$
* $$R_{11} = \{ R_1, B_{10}, B_6 \}$$

> iii. Give a $$T_1-T_2$$ reduction of the flow graph as described in the box on "Where 'Reducible' Comes From" in Section 9.7.2.
