> a) Identify the loops of the flow graph.

* $$\{ B_2, B_3, B_4, B_5 \}$$
* $$\{ B_3, B_4 \}$$

> b) Statements (1) and (2) in $$B_1$$ are both copy statements, in which $$a$$ and $$b$$ can we perform copy propagation and replace these uses of variables by uses of constant? Do so, wherever possible.

> c) Identify any global common subexpressions for each loop.

> d) Identify any induction variables for each loop. Be sure to take into account any constants introduced in (b).

> e) Identify any loop-invariant computations for each loop.

> In Fig. 9.11 is intermediate code to compute the dot product of two vectors $$A$$ and $$B$$. Optimize this code by eliminating common subexpressions, performing reduction in strength on induction variables, and eliminating all the induction variables you can.

```
    dp = 0.
    t1 = 0
    t6 = n * 8
L:  t2 = A[t1]
    t4 = B[t1]
    t5 = t2 * t4
    dp = dp + t5
    t1 = t1 + 8
    if t1 < t6 goto L
