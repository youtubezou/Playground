> a) Identify the loops of the flow graph.

> b) Statements (1) and (2) in $$B_1$$ are both copy statements, in which $$a$$ and $$b$$ can we perform copy propagation and replace these uses of variables by uses of constant? Do so, wherever possible.

> c) Identify any global common subexpressions for each loop.

> d) Identify any induction variables for each loop. Be sure to take into account any constants introduced in (b).

> e) Identify any loop-invariant computations for each loop.
