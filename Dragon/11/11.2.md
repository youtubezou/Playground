## 11.2 Matrix Multiply: An In-Depth Example

### 11.2.1

> The block-based matrix-multiplication algorithm of Fig. 11.8 does not have the initialization of the matrix $$Z$$ to zero, as the code of Fig. 11.5 does. Add the steps that initialize $$Z$$ to all zeros in Fig 11.8.

```
for (ii = 0; ii < n; ii = ii+B)
    for (jj = 0; jj < n; jj = jj+B)
        for (i = ii; i < ii+B; i++)
            for (j = jj; j < jj+B; j++)
                Z[i, j] = 0.0;
        for (kk = 0; kk < n; kk = kk+B)
            for (i = ii; i < ii+B; i++)
                for (j = jj; j < jj+B; j++)
                    for (k = kk; k < kk+B; k++)
                        Z[i, j] = Z[i, j] + X[i, k]*Y[k, j];
```
