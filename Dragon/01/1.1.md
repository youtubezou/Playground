* Compiler: must faster.
* Interpreter: better error diagnostics.

### 1.1.3

> What advantages are there to a language-processing system in which the compiler produces assembly language rather than machine language?

Can be interpreted on another machine.

### 1.1.4

Many compilers available.

### 1.1.5
