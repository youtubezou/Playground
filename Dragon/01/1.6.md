## 1.6 Programming Language Basics

### 1.6.1

> For the block-structured C code of Fig. 1.13(a), indicate the values assigned to $$w$$, $$x$$, $$y$$, and $$z$$.

w = 13, x = 11, y = 13, z = 11

### 1.6.2

> Repeat Exercise 1.6.1 for the code of Fig. 1.13(b).

w = 9, x = 7, y = 13, z = 11

### 1.6.3

> For the block-structure code of Fig. 1.14, assuming the usual static scoping of declarations, give the scope for each of the twelve declarations.

* w: B1, B1, B3, B4, B4
* x: B1, B2, B3, B4, B4
* y: B1, B1, B1, B1, B5
* z: B1, B2, B2, B1, B5

### 1.6.4

> What is printed by the following C code?

* 3
* 2
