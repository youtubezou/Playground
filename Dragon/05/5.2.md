## 5.2 Evaluation Orders for SDD's

### 5.2.1

> What are all the topological sorts for the dependency graph of Fig. 5.7?

* $$[1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]$$
* $$[1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]$$
* $$[1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]$$
* $$[1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]$$
* $$[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]$$
* $$[1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]$$
* $$[2, 1, 3, 5, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]$$
* $$[2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]$$
* $$[2, 1, 4, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]$$

### 5.2.2

> For the SDD of Fig. 5.8, give annotated parse trees for the following expressions:

> a) int a, b, c.

> b) float w, x, y, z.

### 5.2.3

> Suppose that we have a production $$A~\rightarrow~BCD$$. Each of the four nonterminals $$A$$, $$B$$, $$C$$, $$D$$ have two attributes: $$s$$ is a synthesized attribute, and $$i$$ is an inherited attribute. For each of the sets of rules below, tell whether (i) the rules are consistent with an S-attributed definition (ii) the rules are consistent with an L-attributed definition, and (iii) whether the rules are consistent with any evaluation order at all?

> a) $$A.s = B.i + C.s$$.

> b) $$A.s = B.i + C.s$$ and $$D.i = A.i + B.s$$.

> c) $$A.s = B.s + D.s$$.

> d) $$A.s = D.i$$, $$B.i = A.s + C.s$$, $$C.i = B.s$$, and $$D.i = B.i + C.i$$.
