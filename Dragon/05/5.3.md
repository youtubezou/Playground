## 5.3 Applications of Syntax-Directed Translation

### 5.3.1

> Below is a grammar for expressions involving operation $$+$$ and integer or floating-point operands. Floating-point numbers are distinguished by having a decimal point.

> $$
\begin{array}{rll}
E &\rightarrow& E~+~T~|~T \\
T &\rightarrow& \mathbf{num}~.~\mathbf{num}~|~\mathbf{num}
\end{array}
$$

> a) Give an SDD to determine the type of each Term $$T$$ and expression $$E$$.

> b) Extend your SDD of (a) to translate expressions into postfix notation. Use the unary operator __intToFloat__ to turn an integer into an equivalent float.

### 5.3.2

> Give an SDD to translate infix expressions with $$+$$ and $$*$$ into equivalent expressions without redundant parentheses. For example, since both operators associate form the left, and $$*$$ takes precedence over $$+$$, $$((a*(b+c))*(d))$$ translates into $$a*(b+c)*d$$.
