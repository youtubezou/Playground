## 5.5 Implementing L-Attributed SDD's

### 5.5.1

> Implement each of your SDD's of Exercise 5.4.4 as a recursive-descent parser in the style of Section 5.5.1.

a) $$S~\rightarrow~\mathbf{if}~(~C~)~S_1~\mathbf{else}~S_2$$

```
string S(label next) {
    string Ccode, S1code, S2code;
    label L1, L2;
    if (current input == token if) {
        advance input;
        check '(' is next on the input, and advance;
        L1 = new();
        L2 = new();
        Ccode = C(L2, L1);
        check ')' is next on the input, and advance;
        S1code = S(next);
        check 'else' is next on the input, and advance;
        S2code = S(next);
        return (Ccode || label || L1 || S1code || label || L2 || S2code);
    }
}
```

b) $$S~\rightarrow~\mathbf{do}~S_1~\mathbf{while}~(~C~)$$

c) $$S~\rightarrow~\text{'{'}~L~\text{'}'};~L~\rightarrow~L~S~|~\epsilon$$

### 5.5.2

> Implement each of your SDD's of Exercise 5.4.4 as a recursive-descent parser in the style of Section 5.5.2.

### 5.5.3

> Implement each of your SDD's of Exercise 5.4.4 with an LL parser in the style of Section 5.5.3, with code generated "on the fly".

### 5.5.4

> Implement each of your SDD's of Exercise 5.4.4 with an LL parser in the style of Section 5.5.3, but with code stored on the stack.

### 5.5.5

> Implement each of your SDD's of Exercise 5.4.4 with an LR parser in the style of Section 5.5.4.

### 5.5.6

> Implement your SDD of Exercise 5.2.4 in the style of Section 5.5.1. Would an implementation in the style of Section 5.5.2 be any different?
