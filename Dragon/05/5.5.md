## 5.5 Implementing L-Attributed SDD's

### 5.5.1

> Implement each of your SDD's of Exercise 5.4.4 as a recursive-descent parser in the style of Section 5.5.1.

### 5.5.2

> Implement each of your SDD's of Exercise 5.4.4 as a recursive-descent parser in the style of Section 5.5.2.

### 5.5.3

> Implement each of your SDD's of Exercise 5.4.4 with an LL parser in the style of Section 5.5.3, with code generated "on the fly".

### 5.5.4

> Implement each of your SDD's of Exercise 5.4.4 with an LL parser in the style of Section 5.5.3, but with code stored on the stack.

### 5.5.5

> Implement each of your SDD's of Exercise 5.4.4 with an LR parser in the style of Section 5.5.4.

### 5.5.6

> Implement your SDD of Exercise 5.2.4 in the style of Section 5.5.1. Would an implementation in the style of Section 5.5.2 be any different?
