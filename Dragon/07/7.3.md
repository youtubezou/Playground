## 7.3 Access to Nonlocal Data on the Stack

### 7.3.1

> In Fig. 7.15 is a ML function `main` that computes Fibonacci numbers in a nonstandard way. Show the stack of activation records that result from a call to `main`, up until the time that the first call (to `fib0(1)`) is about to return. Show the access link in each of the activation records on the stack.

### 7.3.2

> Suppose that we implement the functions of Fig. 7.15 using a display. Show the display at the moment the first call to `fib0(1)` is about to return. Also, indicate the saved display entry in each of the activation records on the stack at that time.
