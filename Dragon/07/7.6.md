## 7.6 Introduction to Trace-Based Collection

### 7.6.1

> Show the steps of a mark-and-sweep garbage collector on

> a) Fig. 7.19 with the pointer $$A \rightarrow B$$ deleted.

> b) Fig. 7.19 with the pointer $$A \rightarrow C$$ deleted.

> c) Fig. 7.20 with the pointer $$A \rightarrow D$$ deleted.

> d) Fig. 7.20 with the object $$B$$ deleted.

### 7.6.2

> The Baker mark-and-sweep algorithm moves objects among four lists: $$Free$$, $$Unreached$$, $$Unscanned$$, and $$Scanned$$. For each of the object networks of Exercise 7.6.1, indicate for each object the sequence of lists on which it finds itself from just before garbage collection begins until just after it finishes.
