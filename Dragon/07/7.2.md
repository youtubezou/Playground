## 7.2 Stack Allocation of Space

### 7.2.1

> Suppose that the program of Fig. 7.2 uses a _partition_ function that always picks $$a[m]$$ as the separator $$v$$. Also, when the array $$a[m], \cdots, a[n]$$ is reordered, assume that the order is preserved as much as possible. That is, first come all the elements less than $$v$$, in their original order, then all elements equal to $$v$$, and finally all elements greater than $$v$$, in their original order.

> a) Draw the activation tree when the numbers $$9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1$$ are sorted.

* $$m$$
* $$q(1, 9)$$
* $$p(1, 9), q(1, 8), q(10, 9)$$
* $$p(1, 8), q(1, 7), q(9, 8)$$
* $$p(1, 7), q(1, 6), q(8, 7)$$
* $$p(1, 6), q(1, 5), q(7, 6)$$
* $$p(1, 5), q(1, 4), q(6, 5)$$
* $$p(1, 4), q(1, 3), q(5, 4)$$
* $$p(1, 3), q(1, 2), q(4, 3)$$
* $$p(1, 2), q(1, 1), q(3, 2)$$

> b) What is the largest number of activiation records that ever appear together on the stack?

10

### 7.2.2

> Repeat Exercise 7.2.1 when the initial order of the numbers is $$1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8$$.

* $$m$$
* $$q(1, 9)$$
* $$p(1, 9), q(1, 0), q(2, 9)$$
* $$p(2, 9), q(2, 2), q(4, 9)$$
* $$p(4, 9), q(4, 4), q(6, 9)$$
* $$p(6, 9), q(6, 6), q(8, 9)$$
* $$p(8, 9), q(8, 8), q(10, 9)$$

### 7.2.3

> In Fig. 7.9 is C code to compute Fibonacci numbers recursively. Suppose that the activation record for $$f$$ includes the following elements in order: (return value, argument $$n$$, local $$s$$, local $$t$$); there will normally be other elements in the activation record as well. The questions below assume that the initial is $$f(5)$$.

> a) Show the complete activation tree.

> b) What does the stack and its activation records look like the first time $$f(1)$$ is about to return?

|  |
|:-|
| $$\begin{array}{l}\text{return}=? \\ n=5 \\ s=? \\ t=?\end{array}$$ |
| $$\begin{array}{l}\text{return}=? \\ n=4 \\ s=? \\ t=?\end{array}$$ |
| $$\begin{array}{l}\text{return}=? \\ n=3 \\ s=? \\ t=?\end{array}$$ |
| $$\begin{array}{l}\text{return}=? \\ n=2 \\ s=? \\ t=?\end{array}$$ |
| $$\begin{array}{l}\text{return}=1 \\ n=1 \\ s=? \\ t=?\end{array}$$ |

> c) What does the stack and its activation records look like the fifth time $$f(1)$$ is about to return?

|  |
|:-|
| $$\begin{array}{l}\text{return}=? \\ n=5 \\ s=5 \\ t=?\end{array}$$ |
| $$\begin{array}{l}\text{return}=? \\ n=3 \\ s=2 \\ t=?\end{array}$$ |
| $$\begin{array}{l}\text{return}=1 \\ n=1 \\ s=? \\ t=?\end{array}$$ |

### 7.2.4

> Here is a sketch of two C functions $$f$$ and $$g$$:

> ```
int f(int x) { int i; ... return i+1; ... }
int g(int y) { int j; ... f(j+1) ... }
```
> That is, function $$g$$ calls $$f$$. Draw the top of the stack, starting with the activation record for $$g$$, after $$g$$ calls $$f$$, and $$f$$ is about to return. You can consider only return values, parameters, control links, and space for local variables. Answer the following quesionts:

> a) Which function creates the space on the stack for each element?

$$g$$

> b) Which function writes the value of each element?

$$f$$

> c) To which activation record does the element belong?

$$f$$

### 7.2.5

> In a language that passes parameters by reference, there is a function $$f(x, y)$$ that does the following:

> ```
x = x + 1; y = y + 2; return x+y;
```

> If $$a$$ is assigned the value 3, and then $$f(a, a)$$ is called, what is returned?

$$6 + 6 = 12$$

### 7.2.6

> The C function $$f$$ is defined by:

> ```
int f(int x, *py, **ppz) {
    **ppz += 1; *py += 2; x += 3; return x+*py+**ppz;
}
```

> Variable $$a$$ is a pointer to $$b$$; variable $$b$$ is a pointer to $$c$$, and $$c$$ is an integer currently with value 4. If we call $$f(c, b, a)$$, what is returned?

$$7 + 7 + 7 = 21$$
