## 7.2 Stack Allocation of Space

### 7.2.1

> Suppose that the program of Fig. 7.2 uses a _partition_ function that always picks $$a[m]$$ as the separator $$v$$. Also, when the array $$a[m], \cdots, a[n]$$ is reordered, assume that the order is preserved as much as possible. That is, first come all the elements less than $$v$$, in their original order, then all elements equal to $$v$$, and finally all elements greater than $$v$$, in their original order.

> a) Draw the activation tree when the numbers $$9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1$$ are sorted.

* $$m$$
* $$q(1, 9)$$
* $$p(1, 9), q(1, 8), q(10, 9)$$
* $$p(1, 8), q(1, 7), q(9, 8)$$
* $$p(1, 7), q(1, 6), q(8, 7)$$
* $$p(1, 6), q(1, 5), q(7, 6)$$
* $$p(1, 5), q(1, 4), q(6, 5)$$
* $$p(1, 4), q(1, 3), q(5, 4)$$
* $$p(1, 3), q(1, 2), q(4, 3)$$
* $$p(1, 2), q(1, 1), q(3, 2)$$

> b) What is the largest number of activiation records that ever appear together on the stack?

### 7.2.2

> Repeat Exercise 7.2.1 when the initial order of the numbers is $$1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8$$.

* $$m$$
* $$q(1, 9)$$
* $$p(1, 9), q(1, 0), q(2, 9)$$
* $$p(2, 9), q(2, 2), q(4, 9)$$
* $$p(4, 9), q(4, 4), q(6, 9)$$
* $$p(6, 9), q(6, 6), q(8, 9)$$
* $$p(8, 9), q(8, 8), q(10, 9)$$

### 7.2.3

> In Fig. 7.9 is C code to compute Fibonacci numbers recursively. Suppose that the activation record for $$f$$ includes the following elements in order: (return value, argument $$n$$, local $$s$$, local $$t$$); there will normally be other elements in the activation record as well. The questions below assume that the initial is $$f(5)$$.

> a) Show the complete activation tree.

> b) What does the stack and its activation records look like the first time $$f(1)$$ is about to return?

> c) What does the stack and its activation records look like the fifth time $$f(1)$$ is about to return?
