## 7.2 Stack Allocation of Space

### 7.2.1

> Suppose that the program of Fig. 7.2 uses a _partition_ function that always picks $$a[m]$$ as the separator $$v$$. Also, when the array $$a[m], \cdots, a[n]$$ is reordered, assume that the order is preserved as much as possible. That is, first come all the elements less than $$v$$, in their original order, then all elements equal to $$v$$, and finally all elements greater than $$v$$, in their original order.

> a) Draw the activation tree when the numbers $$9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1$$ are sorted.

> b) What is the largest number of activiation records that ever appear together on the stack?
