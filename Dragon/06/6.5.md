> Assuming that function _widen_ in Fig. 6.26 can handle any of the types in the hierarchy of Fig. 6.25(a), translate the expressions below. Assume that $$c$$ and $$d$$ are characters, $$s$$ and $$t$$ are short integers, $$i$$ and $$j$$ are integers, and $$x$$ is a float.

> a) `x = s + c`.

> b) `i = s + c`.

> c) `x = (s + c) * (t + d)`.
