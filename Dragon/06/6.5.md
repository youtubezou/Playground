## 6.5 Type Checking

### 6.5.1

> Assuming that function _widen_ in Fig. 6.26 can handle any of the types in the hierarchy of Fig. 6.25(a), translate the expressions below. Assume that $$c$$ and $$d$$ are characters, $$s$$ and $$t$$ are short integers, $$i$$ and $$j$$ are integers, and $$x$$ is a float.

> a) `x = s + c`.

```
t1 = (int) s
t2 = (int) c
t3 = t1 + t2
t4 = (float) x
x = t4
```

> b) `i = s + c`.

```
t1 = (int) s
t2 = (int) c
t3 = t1 + t2
i = t3
```

> c) `x = (s + c) * (t + d)`.

```
t1 = (int) s
t2 = (int) c
t3 = t1 + t2
t4 = (int) t
t5 = (int) d
t6 = t4 + t5
t7 = t3 * t6
t8 = (float) t7
x = t7
```

### 6.5.2

> As in Ada, suppose that each expression must have a unique type, but that from a subexpression, by itself, all we can deduce is a set of possible types. That is, the application of function $$E_1$$ to argument $$E_2$$, represented by $$E \rightarrow E_1 ( E_2)$$, has the associated rule

> $$E.type = \{ t~|~\text{for some } s \text{ in } E_2.type, s \rightarrow t \text{ is in } E_1.type\}$$

> Describe an SDD that determines a unique type for each subexpression by using an attribute _type_ to synthesize a set of possible types bottom-up, and, once the unique type of the overall expression is determined, proceeds top-down to determine attribute _unique_ for the type of each subexpression.
