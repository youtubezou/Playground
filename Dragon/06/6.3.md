## 6.3 Types and Declarations

### 6.3.1

> Determine the types and relative addresses for the identifiers in the following sequence of declarations:

> ```
float x;
record { float x; float y; } p;
record { int tag; float x; float y;} q;
```

### 6.3.2

> Extend the handling of field names in Fig. 6.18 to classes and single-inheritance class hierarchies.

> a) Give an implementation of class _Env_ that allows linked symbol tables, so that a subclass can either redefine a field name or refer directly to a field name in a superclass.

> b) Give a translation scheme that allocates a contiguous data area for the fields in a class, including inherited fields. Inherited fields must maintain the relative addresses they were assigned in the layout for the superclass.
