## 6.3 Types and Declarations

### 6.3.1

> Determine the types and relative addresses for the identifiers in the following sequence of declarations:

> ```
float x;
record { float x; float y; } p;
record { int tag; float x; float y;} q;
```

| id | type | relative address |
|:---|:-----|:-----------------|
| `x` | `float` | 0 |
| `p.x` | `float` | 0 |
| `p.y` | `float` | 8 |
| `p` | `record` | 8 |
| `q.tag` | `int` | 0 |
| `q.x` | `float` | 4 |
| `q.y` | `float` | 12 |
| `q` | `record` | 24 |

### 6.3.2

> Extend the handling of field names in Fig. 6.18 to classes and single-inheritance class hierarchies.

> a) Give an implementation of class _Env_ that allows linked symbol tables, so that a subclass can either redefine a field name or refer directly to a field name in a superclass.

Each field name is a linked list, subclass insert new definition to the head of the linked list.

> b) Give a translation scheme that allocates a contiguous data area for the fields in a class, including inherited fields. Inherited fields must maintain the relative addresses they were assigned in the layout for the superclass.

Append.
