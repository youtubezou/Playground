## 4.8 Using Ambiguous Grammars

### 4.8.1

> The following is an ambiguous grammar for expressions with $$n$$ binary, infix operators, at $$n$$ different levels of precedencce:

> $$
E~\rightarrow~E~\theta_1~E~|~E~\theta_2~E~|~\cdots~|~E~\theta_n~E~|~(~E~)~|~\mathbf{id}
$$

> a) As a function of $$n$$, what are the SLR sets of items?

$$6 + 2n$$

> b) How would you resolve the conflicts in the SLR items so that all operators are left associative, and $$\theta_n$$ takes precedence over $$\theta_{n-1}$$, which takes precedence over $$\theta_{n-2}$$, and so on?

Shift when the item is constructed by $$E~\rightarrow~E~\theta_i~E$$ followed by $$\theta_j$$ and $$i < j$$, otherwise reduce.
