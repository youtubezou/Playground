1. {3n+2 | n ∈ N}

Top-down:
  A natural number n is in S if and only if
  1. n = 2 or
  2. n - 3 ∈ S.

Bottom-up:
  Define the set S to be the smallest set contained in N and satisfying the following two properties:
  1. 2 ∈ S, and
  2. if n ∈ S, then n + 3 ∈ S.

Rules of inference:
```
  
   ------
   2 ∈ S

     n ∈ S
   ----------
   n + 3 ∈ S
```

2. {2n+3m +1 | n,m ∈ N}

Top-down:
  A natural number n is in S if and only if
  1. n = 1 or
  2. n - 2 ∈ S or
  3. n - 3 ∈ S.

Bottom-up:
  Define the set S to be the smallest set contained in N and satisfying the following three properties:
  1. 1 ∈ S, and
  2. if n ∈ S, then n + 2 ∈ S, and
  3. if n ∈ S, then n + 3 ∈ S.

Rules of inference:
```
  
   ------
   1 ∈ S

     n ∈ S
   ----------
   n + 2 ∈ S

     n ∈ S
   ----------
   n + 3 ∈ S
```

3. {(n, 2n+1) | n ∈ N}

Top-down:
  A natural pair of numbers (n, m) is in S if and only if
  1. n = 0 and m = 1, or
  2. (n - 1, m - 2) ∈ S.

Bottom-up:
  Define the set S to be the smallest set contained in N and satisfying the following two properties:
  1. (0, 1) ∈ S, and
  2. if (n, m) ∈ S, then (n + 1, m + 2) ∈ S.

Rules of inference:
```
  
   -----------
   (0, 1) ∈ S

        (n, m) ∈ S
   -------------------
   (n + 1, m + 2) ∈ S
```

4. {(n, n^2) | n ∈ N}

Top-down:
  A natural pair of numbers (n, m) is in S if and only if
  1. n = 0 and m = 0, or
  2. (n - 1, m - 2n + 1) ∈ S.

Bottom-up:
  Define the set S to be the smallest set contained in N and satisfying the following two properties:
  1. (0, 0) ∈ S, and
  2. if (n, m) ∈ S, then (n + 1, m + 2n + 1) ∈ S.

Rules of inference:
```
  
   -----------
   (0, 0) ∈ S

         (n, m) ∈ S
   ------------------------
   (n + 1, m + 2n + 1) ∈ S
```
