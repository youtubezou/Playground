1. Identifier has same number of left and right parentheses, which are all 0.
2. Let L, R be the numbers of left and right parentheses in <expression>, respectively.
   The number of parentheses in (lambda (Identifier) LcExp) is L + 2 and R + 2, L + 2 = R + 2;
   The number of parentheses in (LcExp LcExp) is L + 1 and R + 1, L + 1 = R + 1.
