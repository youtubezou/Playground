> Exercise 1.3 [*] Find a set T of natural numbers such that 0 ∈ T, and whenever n ∈ T,
> then n + 3 ∈ T, but T ≠ S, where S is the set defined in definition 1.1.2.

> Definition 1.1.2 Define the set S to be the smallest set contained in N and satisfying the following two properties:
> 1. 0 ∈ S, and
> 2. if n ∈ S, then n + 3 ∈ S.
